For bugs, feel free to create a GitHub issue.
If you have an idea for a feature that doesn't exist, feel free to file an issue as well.

If you would like to contribute code, I'm definitely open to it, my main ask is that it be
something that's not too specific of a use-case and a use-case that would generally be useful
to implement.  For very specific use-cases, I would argue that it can be implemented by the
user of this library.  Thank you for your understanding!
